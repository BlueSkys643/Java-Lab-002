this file is my response to the interpretation questions in the readme as I could not figure out
  how to make changes to the readme file.

Take note of the various variables and their data types. Write a brief summary in this section
  of the README.md file listing the:

Variable name
Its data type
and example values you can assign them.

There is a list of String variables called scriptTemplate
there is another String that is just the word "priceless"
an int variable for the amount of people called people
a float for ticketPrice... so you can use floats
a double called itemPrice, I see the difference now.
a Boolean called true or false which appears to have no function outside of providing an example
  of a boolean and how it prints to console

Next give TWO example variable names and TWO example variable assignments that are WRONG and explain why.

example 1: String jerseyPrice = 90;
wrong because it is defined as a String but the value assigned to the variable is an int
example 2: bool dayTime = True;
wrong because in java it is declared as boolean, in c# I believe it is declared as a bool

Hint: your IDE can help you discover these!
